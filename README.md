Remote hotwater controller


I need a method to control a hotwater system from anywhere there is an internet connection.

This was for a holiday home and rather than turn up and there be no hotwater for the first day it would be nice to arrive and there be hotwater.

This board is designed to power a Wemos D1 Mini Pro set up as a webserver.

The hotwater system can be turned on from the webpage as well as allowing the time for the hotwater system to run (defaults to 24 hours).

Realistically it can be used to control anything that can be switched from the Wemos.

I use a SSR-40DA solid state relay to control the hotwater system.
